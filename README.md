# Distributions and Sampling Lecture  

Lecture V2.1 Distributions and Sampling Lecture for London Flatiron Campus.
Some of the materials used here were originall taken from [this lecture on confidence intervals](https://github.com/learn-co-students/on_confidence_intervals_seattle-ds/blob/master/on_confidence_intervals.ipynb) and [this lecture on sampling](https://github.com/learn-co-students/dsc-sampling-012720/blob/master/sampling.ipynb).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the lesson students should be able to... 

* [ ] Explain the relationship between samples and populations
* [ ] Explain how descriptive and inferential statistics relate to samples and populations 
* [ ] Describe what a statistical distribution is (shape of data) 
* [ ] Explain properties of the normal distribution 
* [ ] Define the CLT and describe its relation to samples and populations 
* [ ] Describe what information is captured by a confidence interval  
* [ ] List what parameters go into calculating a confidence interval
* [ ] Explain the CI RPsychologist simulation
